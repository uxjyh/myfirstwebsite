<h2>Russia는 왜 우크라이나를 침공하는가? </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">Hello web</a>
Thousands of people are fleeing Ukraine's Donbas as <strong>Russia shifts the <u>focus</u> of its attacks</strong> to the east of the country.

As Nato foreign ministers gather in Brussels, the next phase of Russia’s war in Ukraine is very much on their minds.<br>

Nato’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg thinks it will be some weeks before Russia's ready to launch its next big offensive in the Donbas.<br>

Troops and equipment have only just been withdrawn from the area around Kyiv and will take time to be resupplied and relocated to the east.<br>

Other forces including foreign fighters, mercenaries and conscripts are being added to the mix.

But when the offensive comes, Nato officials warn that it will be “horrendous and barbaric”.<br>

They believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to be able to declare some kind of victory, however limited, by 9 May when Russia holds its annual Victory Day parade,
marking the defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of the Second World War.<br>

Nato members are determined to use the coming days and weeks to make sure Ukraine is as ready as it can be, and deny the Kremlin anything to celebrate.<br>
